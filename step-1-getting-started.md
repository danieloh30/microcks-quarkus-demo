# Step 1: Getting Started

Before getting started, let's make sure you have everything you need for running this demo.

## Prerequisites

### Install Java 17 or newer

You'll need Java 17 or newer for this workshop.
Testcontainers libraries are compatible with Java 8+, but this workshop uses a Quarkus 3.x application which requires Java 17 or newer.

We would recommend using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/) to install Java on your machine if you are using MacOS, Linux or Windows WSL.

### Install Docker

You need to have a Docker environment to use Testcontainers.

```shell
$ docker version
