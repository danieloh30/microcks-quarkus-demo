# Step 3: Local development experience with Microcks

Our application uses Kafka and external dependencies.

At first, if you run the application from your terminal without integrating Microcks, you would see the following traces:

```shell
./mvnw quarkus:dev

```

You can see that [Dev Services for Kafka](https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka-dev-services) are started automatically because we included a Kafka client
into our project dependencies. However, there's no such default Dev Services when using the Rest client to call our external Pastry API provider!

Just issue a simple API request using CURL or Postman or any of your favourite HTTP Client tools. 

```shell
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/orders -H 'Content-type: application/json' \                                                                                                                                                                                                                      â”€â•¯
    -d '{"customerId": "lbroudoux", "productQuantities": [{"productName": "Eclair Cafe", "quantity": 1}], "totalPrice": 4.1}'
```

You should get a response similar to the following:

```shell
< HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
< content-length: 0
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
```

and on the terminal where application is running, something like this:

```shell
2024-02-21 10:12:49,863 ERROR [org.acm.ord.api.OrderResource] (executor-thread-1) Unexpected runtime exception: Error injecting org.acme.order.client.PastryAPIClient org.acme.order.service.OrderService.pastryRepository
2024-02-21 10:12:49,863 ERROR [org.acm.ord.api.OrderResource] (executor-thread-1) Root cause: Unable to determine the proper baseUrl/baseUri. Consider registering using @RegisterRestClient(baseUri="someuri"), @RegisterRestClient(configKey="orkey"), or by adding 'quarkus.rest-client."org.acme.order.client.PastryAPIClient".url' or 'quarkus.rest-client."org.acme.order.client.PastryAPIClient".uri' to your Quarkus configuration
```

To run this application locally, we need Microcks Dev Services ðŸª„ to have our Pastry API mocked!

In order to see what's needed to run this, you may check the `pom.xml` and `application.properties` files.


## Review pom.xml and application.properties

First, the `quarkus-microcks` dependency must be added to your project dependencies like illustrated below:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.github.microcks.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-microcks</artifactId>
  <version>${quarkus-microcks.version}</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

The dependency scope can be set to `provided` as this dependency will only be used during development mode or unit tests. You don't need to package them into
your application.

In order to wire the application to Microcks, we also need to update the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file so that we specify to Microcks
provided endpoints for both the Pastry API REST endpoint and the Kafka topic for receiving reviewed orders:

```properties
quarkus.rest-client."org.acme.order.client.PastryAPIClient".url=${quarkus.microcks.default.http}/rest/API+Pastries/0.0.1

mp.messaging.incoming.orders-reviewed.topic=OrderEventsAPI-0.1.0-orders-reviewed
```

You'll notice that we use `${quarkus.microcks.default.http}` expression to specify the dynamically assigned Microcks HTTP endpoint.

## Application startup with Microcks DevServices

Now that we've got everything configured, we can start again the application. In the traces below, we only kept the significant parts related to Microcks DevServices usage:

```

Let's understand why we got those messages at startup:

* First, you can see that the `DevServicesKafkaProcess` output is a bit different... This time we have a `PLAINTEXT://kafka-8fvsj:29092` endpoint and this one will be used by Microcks DevServices.
* Second, you can see that the `DevServicesMicrocksProcessor` is starting a Microcks container that will be available at `http://localhost:61705`.
* Then, you can see that this processor is also starting a some other containers like `microcks-postman-runtime` and `microcks-uber-async-minion`.
  This is not always the case and depends on your project configuration. Those services have been started here because we have Postman Collection files in our resources and because we have a Kafka broker running.
* Just after the Quarkus logo, you can see that Microcks DevServices as also contributed a bunch of `quarkus.microcks.*` properties
* Finally, after the application has started, you'll see messages about `Receiving a reviewed order with id...` that means that Microcks has started producing mock messages and the application is processing them.

And that's it! ðŸŽ‰ You don't need to download and install extra-things, or clone other repositories and figure out how to start your dependant services.

Now, you can invoke the APIs using CURL or Postman or any of your favourite HTTP Client tools.


## Create an order

```shell
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/orders -H 'Content-type: application/json' \                                                                                                                                      â”€â•¯
    -d '{"customerId": "lbroudoux", "productQuantities": [{"productName": "Millefeuille", "quantity": 1}], "totalPrice": 5.1}'
```

You should get a response similar to the following:

```shell
< HTTP/1.1 201 
< Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
< content-length: 172
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
{"id":"0ddb2ad0-a74d-4b1c-84bc-f272349ef091","status":"CREATED","customerId":"lbroudoux","productQuantities":[{"productName":"Millefeuille","quantity":1}],"totalPrice":5.1}%
```

Now test with something else, requesting for another Pastry:

```shell
curl -XPOST localhost:8080/api/orders -H 'Content-type: application/json' \
    -d '{"customerId": "lbroudoux", "productQuantities": [{"productName": "Eclair Chocolat", "quantity": 1}], "totalPrice": 4.1}' -v
```

This time you get another "exception" response:

```shell
< HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Entity
< Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
< content-length: 85
< 
* Connection #0 to host localhost left intact
{"productName":"Eclair Chocolat","details":"Pastry Eclair Chocolat is not available"}%
```

and this is because Microcks has created different simulations for the Pastry API 3rd party API based on API artifacts we loaded.
Check the `src/test/resources/third-parties/apipastries-openapi.yaml` and `src/test/resources/third-parties/apipastries-postman-collection.json` files to get details.
